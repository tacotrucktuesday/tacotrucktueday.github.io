We want food vendors that showcase the diversity in America.\r\n### I am a street food vendor (tent, cart, etc), can I join the cause?\r\nYes! There are not enough trucks to be at every polling place, we need all the help we can get.\r\n### I run a BBQ team, church potluck, etc; can we join the cause?\r\nProbably, you will need to check your communities regulations about selling or giving away food on the streets.\r\n### My local polling place is a school (or in a residential neighborhood), can I park a truck there?\r\nMaybe, you will need to reach out to your city, they may have regulations about street food near schools, or zoning laws preventing commerce in some neighborhoods. There are often ways around these rules though. For example setting up on private property or finding a sponsor to pay for catering so you are not selling.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nAt this time, this is just a website and an idea.
